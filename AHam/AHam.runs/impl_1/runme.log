WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net kb/space3_out is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin kb/space_reg_i_2/O, cell kb/space_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net kb/w9_out is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin kb/w_reg_i_2/O, cell kb/w_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
